## Introduction

Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, is a critical metric for businesses in various industries. It refers to the percentage of customers who stop using a company's products or services during a certain time period. Predicting customer churn is essential for businesses to develop strategies for customer retention and growth. This project uses machine learning techniques to predict customer churn based on historical customer data.

## Project Overview

The Customer Churn Prediction Analysis project includes the following components:

- Data collection and preprocessing: The project starts by collecting customer data, cleaning it, and preparing it for machine learning.

- Feature engineering: Creating relevant features and transforming the data for model training.

- Model selection: Choosing and training machine learning models to predict customer churn.

- Evaluation: Assessing model performance and determining how well the models predict customer churn.

- Deployment: Deploying the best-performing model for real-time customer churn prediction.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software and libraries installed:

- Python (3.6+)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended)
- Required Python libraries (install via `pip`):
  - pandas
  - scikit-learn
  - matplotlib
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - seaborn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Customer-Churn-Prediction-Analysis.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Customer-Churn-Prediction-Analysis
   ```

3. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Open and run the `Data_Preprocessing.ipynb` notebook to clean and preprocess the raw customer data. Alternatively, you can use the scripts in the `src` directory.

2. **Model Training**: Use the `Model_Training.ipynb` notebook to train machine learning models to predict customer churn. You can also run the scripts in the `src` directory for this purpose.

3. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the model's performance using the `Model_Evaluation.ipynb` notebook. This notebook also contains model deployment instructions.
